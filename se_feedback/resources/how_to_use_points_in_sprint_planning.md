# How to use Points in Sprint Planning

Here's a quick guide to using points in estimating effort during a sprint.

Estimating the size of a task is like estimating the height of buildings. Looking at the image above, it's hard to accurately estimate the height in metres of these buildings. The same goes for estimating the size of a task in hours, it's hard to get it right.

Estimating if a building is taller than another building is a lot easier. Looking at the picture above, there are 2 buildings in the centre that are visible taller than the buildings around them.

How do points fit into this? Pick a small building (pink, 2nd to the left) and define it as 1 point. The tall the buildings in the centre are 2 or 3 times as tall so they are worth 2-3 points.

The same logic works for tasks. Pick a small (preferably smallest task) and define it as 1 point. Estimate how much more effort a second task is and then multiply.

A recommended way to do this in a group is by using a process called [planning poker](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/planning-poker).
