## General

* I found the way you capitalize words a bit odd, e.g. Pull Requests, Peer Reviewing, Software Engineering. I would actually just write them all down in lowercase.
* Ensure that you use the same way of capitalizing your chapters. You might want to consider this: http://titlecapitalization.com/.

## Introduc(k)tion

* Most of the introduction is about Git itself, which in my opinion is redundant. I would have rather focused more on research done on GitHub, the results, and make even more clear why Octopeer is different.

## Target Audience

* Based on the second paragraph, it seems that there is only one target audience. I know, I am nitpicking.
* When using a references, e.g. Rigby et al. and Beller et al., please make clear (in at least one sentence) what they do and how their work is related to your work.

## Needs of the Customer

* Once again, I think that not all software engineers dislike code reviews.
* Since you have two target groups, and the researchers are quite different from software developers, I would have preferred to see how you address the need of both groups.
