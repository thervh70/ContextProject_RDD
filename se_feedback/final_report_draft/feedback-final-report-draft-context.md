## Introduction, including a brief problem description and end-user's requirements

* It would be nice to have a small paragraph where you describe the problem.
  What problem are you solving?
* I think that a small section about your end-users is needed to clarify the requirements. For example, why are *maintainability* and *extensibility* requirements for the end-user? This can only be explained if researchers are part of your end-user definition.

## Overview of the developed and implemented software product

-

## Reflection on the product and process from a software engineering perspective

* I would consider placing the first sentence of "The Product" section in the end instead. This way, it sounds more like a conclusion based on your explanation of how well-designed the system is.
* Applying design patterns does not mean that it is well-designed.

## Description of the developed functionalities

-

## Special section on interaction design (development of the HCI module)

-

## Evaluation of the functional modules and the product in its entirety, including the failure analysis

-

## Outlook

* "Generating feedback" could be discussed more in depth, i.e. give a concrete example.
