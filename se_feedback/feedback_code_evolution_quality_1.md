##Notes
* Good start on the ADD, Introduc(k)tion made me laugh
* Good start on setting up tools, now just make sure to use them fully
* Documents should also be submitted to the repo via pull requests, review it one last time as a sanity check
* Speaking of code, 7 in those categories was given to reflect that you focussed on requirements gathering and context analysis
