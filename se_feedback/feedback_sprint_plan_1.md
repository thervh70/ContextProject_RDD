The Sprint Plan will be graded when you turn in the retorspective this Friday (April 29).

* Nice of Definition of Done
* Nicely defined user stories
* I like the underlined task types
* Well defined effort per assignee
* Well done and keep it up
* Adding a table with the total effort assigned per person is a good check if you split the tasks evenly (both for you and me)

BTW: `[name](link)` is how you can avoid large urls on your README (please do so for the deliverables)
