## Notes
* Well done
* That Matthias took over Robin's task should be added in a note, it looks like both were assigned responsibility and then one member was removed
* Why is the row Octopeer from Logging Data empty and what is it?
* Blank page 3
* Make sure everyone catches up again on their hours in the next sprints.
