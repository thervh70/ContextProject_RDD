#Feedback
Feedback for the product planning draft.

##Introduction
* Interesting start about healthcare.gov but include a reference
	* Also how does this connect to scrum in the next paragraph?
* Scrum is a proven methodology? Reference please

##Product

###1.1.1
* The extension will log a user’s actions when they are looking at a Pull Request on GitHub.	* Which actions?* A number of user­triggered events will be monitored and saved (in a database)	* Hoe many and which events?
* The performance of the extension cannot decrease the performance of the browser in a way that is noticeable for the average user.
	* Make this concrete so you know if you've reached this goal (1000ms, 500ms, 100ms, etc)
* The extension will deduce new information from the data that is retrieved.
	* Make this concrete
* The icon of the extension should indicate whether the extension is recording
	* Good requirement, keeping your users in mind!

###1.1.2
* The extension should be able to visualize information that is retrieved and deduced in terms of graphs.
	* Not your requirement per se, though if you do include this it is a must. Octopeer isn't done if the analytics isn't done and integrated.

###1.1.4
* The extension won’t deduce data from a pressure sensor that is build into chairs.
	* Maybe not chairs but what about pressure sensative devices such as the new Mac books and iPhone 6s Plus?
	* Also it's built

###1.2
* Refer to the table (label it) in the text
* When is the integration with the BitBucket Team planned? Integration Visualisation is a misleading title

##User Stories
* "Because the difference between the user and the developer might not be clear, because of our context,	"
	* Just define the two, no need to add more text about it

* As a user I want that the system that I’m using has been fully researched well on how to develop it
	* No idea what this means, restructure your sentence
	
* As a developer I want the collected data to be stored in a permanent nature.
	* A persistant manner might be a better way of phrasing it

* As a developer I want to start developing the system in a systematic way So that I’m sure that I won’t forget important things while developing
	* Quite a tongue twister

* User stories of know­how acquisition
	* How will your user learn how to use Octopeer
	
* Will the product crash silently or alert the user that something went wrong, assume your system isn't perfect
	
##Definition of Done

###Document construction
* Spell checked and grammar checked should be part of this definition
	* Also peer review it
* Speaking of, check for blank pages
