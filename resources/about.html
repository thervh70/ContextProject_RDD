                Octopeer is a chrome extension that will help you analyze your personal code reviewing behaviour.
                While reviewing code in pull requests on both GitHub and BitBucket this extension will collect data.
                Please note that this extension is meant for GitHub, for BitBucket please follow <a href="https://bitbucket.org/CasBs/ooc-octopeer">this link</a>.
                This data can be viewed on the analytics section of our extension.
                It gives you several useful overviews of your behaviour.

            <p>
                First of all, your data will be viewed to yourself.
                That is the main purpose of our extension, giving you personal insights through visualisation.
                Next to that the data might be used for research at the Delft University of Technology.
                These researches can yield surprising results when the researchers are equipped with a nice dataset.
                Both the visualisation as well as the researches might change the way you do your reviews.

            <p class="flow-text">Who developed Octopeer? </p>
            <p>
                Delft University of Technology organizes several projects each year.
                This extension is the result of the so-called Contextproject for 2nd year bachelor students
                of Computer Science.
                Several small teams, consisting of 5 people, have worked together under the supervision of Alberto Bacchelli.
                Together we have built this exciting tool that can be used by many developers and software engineers.
